This is a assemblage of some linux software configure

## vim 
I use vim configure from vimplus https://github.com/chxuan/vimplus     
It's a very concise and useful vim configure program, you just execute one command, and all the plugins will be installed automaticly.      
Just try it, you will love it!


## tmux
Tmux is a very useful terminal multiplexer, but the defualt shortcuts are not convenient and easy to forget. I change the tmux configure, so that I can use some shortcuts like vim
